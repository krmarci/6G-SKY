# Abstract

Communication has been one of the pillars of civilization for all of human history. In recent times, communication has become faster and more interconnected than ever before. This study focuses on a project that aims to create a new breakthrough in the world of telecommunications.

Within the framework of the 6G-SKY project, European governments and tech companies aim to establish a 6G network for air passengers, one of the few segments where telecommunication has been limited for technological and legal reasons. The project plans to install an array of transmitters including satellites, drones, aircraft, and cell towers.

This study is concerned with the optimal placement of transmitters. As a first step, the methodological groundwork is laid, including a heuristic solution for the smallest-circle problem, basic formulae of spherical geometry, as well as data cleaning.

For determining the optimal transmitter placement, this study uses complete-linkage agglomerative clustering, a clustering method known for its effectiveness creating a non-pre-determined amount of equal-diameter circular clusters. The results show a redundant network of transmitters, which helps make the network more robust. Despite the limitations of this study, even a small number of transmitters is able to achieve a high coverage ratio of airplanes.
